# Word-Embedding-Effects-in-Indonesian-Social-Media-LSTM
<p style="text-align: justify;">  Social media serves as a platform where individuals interact with each other. Social media not only allows users to share their created content but also generates a wide range of opinions. From these many viewpoints, some may lead to disagreements and, unfortunately, certain individuals may resort to cyberbullying on these platforms. 
  The aim of this research is to determine the difference in performance of the LSTM text classifier for classifying cyberbullying sentences using the word embedding techniques TF-IDF, Word2vec, and FastText. The dataset used is a combination of Instagram comments taken from Kaggle and tweets sourced from previous research. The data obtained for this research consists of a total of 1570 entries, with 785 labeled as '0' for non-cyberbullying and 785 as '1' for cyberbullying. The testing data size is 20% of the total entries, and the testing data is balanced between labels '0' and '1'. The test results indicate that LSTM using different text representations has an accuracy of 82.33% for TF-IDF, 78.98% for Word2Vec, and 59.23% for FastText.
